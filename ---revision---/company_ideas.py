You are given an array of strings ideas where each string represents an idea. 
You want to name a company using two different ideas by swapping their first letters, and if the new words formed do not exist in the original list, then the pair is valid.

Key Constraints:
All strings are distinct
1 <= ideas.length <= 10^5
1 <= ideas[i].length <= 10
All ideas are lowercase English letters
