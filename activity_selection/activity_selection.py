'''
You are given n activities with their start and finish times.
Select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person,
assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time.

O(nlogn) -- This uses Pythonâ€™s built-in sorted() function, which is implemented using Timsort, a hybrid sorting algorithm
derived from merge sort and insertion sort.
