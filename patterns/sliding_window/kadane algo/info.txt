✅ Kadane’s Algorithm Logic:

We iterate through the array and at each position i, we ask:

Should we continue the previous subarray (current_sum + nums[i])?
Or start a new subarray from nums[i]?
We keep track of the current maximum sum ending at this index and update the global max whenever it increases.
