'''
Given a string s, find the length of the longest subsequence which appears at least twice in the string, 
without overlapping at the same indices.

ðŸ“Œ Subsequence: A sequence that can be derived by deleting some or no elements without changing the order.
ðŸ“Œ Repeated: The subsequence must appear at least twice, but at different indices.
